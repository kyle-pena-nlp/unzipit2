## What is this?

An abandoned one-off project.  
The idea was to WASM compile a Rust library capable of compressing/decompressing all sorts of standard "zip file" formats.
Then, build a one-page frontend app and do the file decompression purely clientside (because it's WASM).
Got it working on a basic level, then did some investigation of the competition and realized that the SEO game was too competitive in this niche.
Oh well!
